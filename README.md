Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This project was done for the client DriverPass, they wanted a web service designed to provide online learning and scheduling for driving lessons.

What did you do particularly well?
What I feel I did particularly well was explore the client's desires with the diagrams, as I took ideas and feedback from others I built more upon my diagrams to create a better image for the client's goal.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one thing I would go back and ensure that I tackled all of the requirements that the client wanted. Looking back there are integral details that I missed that could have been an issue in the real world. To improve I could focus more on revising and going over the client's initial requests multiple times to ensure that I have all the requirements gathered.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by breaking them down into processes of what must be implemented or done to accomplish the goal in mind. It's important to keep in mind the user's needs because ultimately if the user experience isn't good then the product won't be useable and won't fulfill the client's goal of a product that makes the user's lives easier.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach the designing software with an open mind because to me it's important to tackle issues without bias as ultimately the client's desires are above all, if there isn't an inherent issue with the design then follow the client's wishes. Techniques I would use in the future would be to be more detail-oriented about gathering requirements. The requirements stage is one of the most important, and to create the perfect image of the clients goal every detail must be scrutinized.
