Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This project was done fo rthe client DriverPass, they wanted a web service designed ot provide online learning and scheduling for driving lessons.

What did you do particularly well?
What I feel I did particularly well was explore the clients desires with the diagrams, as I took ideas and feedback from others I built more upon my diagrams to create a better image for the clients goal.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one thing I would go back and ensure that I tackled all of the requirments that the client wanted. Looking back there are integral details that I missed that could have been an issue in the real world. To improve I could focus more on revising and going over the clients initilas requests multiple times to ensure that I have all the requirements gathered.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the users needs by breaking them down into processes of what must be implemnted or get done to have the goal in mind be accomplished. Its important to keep in mind the users needs because ultimately if the user experience isnt good then the product wont be useable and wont fulfill the clients goal of a product that makes the users lives easier.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach the designing software with an open mind because to me its important to tackle issues without bias as ultimately the clients desires are above all, if there isnt an inherent issue with the design then follow the clients wishes. Techniques i would use in the future would be to be more detail oreiented about gathering requirments. The requirments stage is one of the most important, and to create the perfect image of the clients goal every detail must be scrutinized.
